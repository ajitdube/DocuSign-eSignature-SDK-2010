Readme.txt for DocuSign SDK Salesforce NDAKios sample
===========================================================================

System Requirements:
-	Salesforce Developer Edition account

Overview:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This sample code requires a DocuSign DevCenter account. If you do not
already have a DevCenter account please go to
http://www.docusign.com/devcenter/ and sign up for one. This sample will
not function without a valid DevCenter account.

This sample shows how to construct VisualForce pages optimized for an
Apple iPad Safari browser. The use case is for a company that requires
vistors to sign an NDA at the front desk. Instead of handing the visitor
a paper copy to sign, this app lets the user electronically sign the NDA
using an iPad on display! 

Static resources are provided in the sample that can be changed to the
company's branding; including the icon that appears when the app is
bookmarked to the iPad Home Screen!

Refer to Readme.pdf for a walkthrough on how to implement this from a 
Salesforce Dev account.
